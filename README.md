# Dynamic Behavior Model - Interactive Agent Simulation

## Overview
The **Dynamic Behavior Model** is an interactive simulation designed to demonstrate **state management**, **behavior modeling**, and **reactive system logic**. In this project, users interact with virtual pets, each possessing unique personalities, to see how different actions influence their behaviors. This system serves as a practical example of how complex interactions are managed in real-time applications.

## Key Features ðŸš€
- **Behavior-Driven Personalities**: Pets have varying personalities (Playful, Shy, Grumpy, Affectionate) that respond differently to user interactions.
- **State Management Simulation**: Track the petâ€™s moods, energy levels, and affection states as they change in real-time based on user actions.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Petsâ€™ reactions update dynamically, providing clear insights into how each action impacts their behavior.
- **Interaction History**: Learn which actions are most effective with different personalities by reviewing past interactions.

## How It Works ðŸ§ 
This project simulates reactive systems by using **state management** to model real-time interactions. Each pet responds to a series of user actions, such as feeding, playing, or gifting, according to their personality and current state. This provides a hands-on understanding of how complex systems like **AI agents** and **game mechanics** operate.
